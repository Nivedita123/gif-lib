I created this MVC based application based on what I learned from the TreeHouse Java Web developement course.

The frameworks used are listed below - 

- #### Gradle
  For build automation
  
- #### Thymeleaf
  The template engine for serving HTML5 at the view layer of the web application
  
- #### Spring boot
  To create a RESTful API
  
- #### Hibernate
  For mapping the object-oriented domain model to a relational database

- #### H2 Database Engine
  The relational database which is written in Java
